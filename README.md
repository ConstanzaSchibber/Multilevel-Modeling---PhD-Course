# Teaching-MultilevelModeling

I was teaching assistant of this course when Jeff Gill taught it at Washington University in Saint Louis (School of Public Health). Then, I taught this course as a Postdoc at the University of Virginia and then twice at Michigan State University when I was an Assistant Professor (tenure-track).

Some of the material is from Gelman and Hill's excellent book on Hierarchical Modeling. Some of the code on the book and on Gelman's website needs some changing (partly because R and packages have change over time) for it to work. The key aspects of the code on the book works; it's usually bugs here and there. Some of the code was fixed by Jeff Gill and I took that and also did my own additions.

[Lab 1: Linear and Generalized Linear Regression (G & H, Chapters 1 to 4)](https://github.com/ConstanzaSchibber/Multilevel-Modeling---PhD-Course/blob/main/Lab%201/MLMLab1.md)

[Lab 2: Basics of Multilevel Modeling (G & H Chapter 12)](https://github.com/ConstanzaSchibber/Multilevel-Modeling---PhD-Course/blob/main/Lab%202/MLMLab2TheBasics.md)

[Lab 3: Group Level Predictors and Other Complexities (G & H Chapter 13)](https://github.com/ConstanzaSchibber/Multilevel-Modeling---PhD-Course/blob/main/Lab%203/MLMLab3.md)

[Lab 4: Cross-Level Interactions & Visualization in Hierarchical Modeling](https://github.com/ConstanzaSchibber/Multilevel-Modeling---PhD-Course/blob/main/Lab%204/MLMLab4Visualization.md) 

I developed this Lab; it uses MC simulations for visualization and shows how to calculate/graph marginal effects. I replicate a paper's analysis end-to-end and show problem points and better ways to provide evidence in support of the hypotheses. 

[Lab 5: Hierarchical Logit Modeling (G & H Chapter 14) and Multilevel Regression Post-Stratification](https://github.com/ConstanzaSchibber/Multilevel-Modeling---PhD-Course/blob/main/Lab%205/MLMLab5Logit.md) 

To be continued... I need to add more labs
